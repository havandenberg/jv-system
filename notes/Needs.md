Data collection consolidation
* Files spread out between drives and emails
* Data in as400

Slow and costly to maintain

Some customization built by microsoft? Maintained by a contractor?

Halsey think Vac owns the customized code

Users
* Sales - 5 people
* Operations - 10 people
	* Order Entry
	* Order Management
	* Truck Loading - pick ticket
	* Inventory Management
* Account - 7 people

Sub classes of users:
* Comfortable with AS400
* Uncomfortable with AS400. Technically inept.

Pain points:
* Order entry
* No general ledge from accounting

There are a lot of gaps in understanding the as400 and the customization code.

Servers local and backup shipped else where.
