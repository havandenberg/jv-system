Load Number is one to one with order number. Not clear why order number isn't used. Something about hold orders. Isn't that just a boolean?

Order and load number are kept in Excel.

Courtney has a master list of shipping orders in google sheets.

Repack spreadsheet as also duplicated from the orders that Nancy is entering.
C3 is a 10 by 3?

Several spreadsheets maintained manually.

Sales Report generated manually for growers. The data is confusing since pallets are repacked. Courtney doesn't think the current process is useful to review. Make something new.

Priority:
Courtney - Sales Reports. Tedious and Broken.
